\subsection{ABSTRACT}\label{abstract}}

The incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity is
argued to be a fundamental consequence of embedded observation.
Observers within the universe access reality through projections that
discard causally inaccessible degrees of freedom defined by spacetime's
causal structure. Applying Wolpert's (2008) inference limits, we
establish the \textbf{Observational Incompleteness Theorem}: quantum and
gravitational vacuum energy measurements are variance-type and mean-type
projections of a shared hidden sector, and no embedded device can
simultaneously determine both. The 10\textsuperscript{122} cosmological
constant discrepancy is thereby reinterpreted as a direct measurement of
\textasciitilde10\textsuperscript{244} hidden-sector degrees of freedom.

We then prove the \textbf{Trace-Out Theorem}: assuming only classical
Liouville dynamics, classical general relativity, and classical
probability theory, marginalizing over the correlated hidden sector
produces generically indivisible stochastic dynamics on the visible
sector. By Barandes' stochastic-quantum correspondence, this indivisible
process is exactly equivalent to unitary quantum mechanics. The
Schrödinger equation emerges as the unique time-local description of
history-dependent classical marginals. The framework yields falsifiable
predictions, including post-merger gravitational wave echoes and a
stochastic noise floor anchored to the 10\textsuperscript{122} ratio.

\hypertarget{the-incompatibility}{%
\subsubsection{1.1 The Incompatibility}\label{the-incompatibility}}

Quantum mechanics and general relativity are extraordinarily successful
yet structurally incompatible. This paper argues that the
incompatibility is not a defect requiring unification but a consequence
of embedded observation.

\hypertarget{the-cosmological-discrepancy}{%
\subsubsection{1.2 The Cosmological
Discrepancy}\label{the-cosmological-discrepancy}}

The sharpest manifestation of the QM--GR incompatibility is the
\textbf{cosmological constant problem}. It concerns the single quantity
that both frameworks predict: the energy density of empty space,
\(\rho_{\text{vac}}\).

\textbf{Quantum mechanics} computes the vacuum energy by summing
zero-point fluctuations of all quantum field modes up to the Planck
scale:
\[\rho_{\text{QM}} \sim \frac{E_{\text{Pl}}^{\,4}}{(\hbar c)^3} \sim 10^{113} \; \text{J/m}^3\]

\textbf{General relativity} measures the vacuum energy through its
gravitational effect --- the accelerated expansion of the universe:
\[\rho_{\text{grav}} = \frac{\Lambda \, c^2}{8\pi G} \sim 6 \times 10^{-10} \; \text{J/m}^3\]

The ratio is conventionally rounded to 10\textsuperscript{120} in the
literature {[}2,3,5{]}, or more precisely 10\textsuperscript{122}. A
different interpretation is proposed: \textbf{neither calculation is
wrong. They disagree because they are answering fundamentally different
questions about the same thing}.

INCOMPLETENESS}\label{observational-incompleteness}}

\hypertarget{observers-are-embedded}{%
\subsubsection{2.1 Observers Are
Embedded}\label{observers-are-embedded}}

Wolpert (2008) {[}1{]} proved that any physical device performing
observation, prediction, or recollection --- an ``inference device'' ---
faces fundamental limits on what it can know about the universe it
inhabits. These limits hold \textbf{independent of the laws of physics}.
They follow solely from the logical structure of a device that is
embedded in the system it attempts to describe, forcing any observation
to be a surjective, many-to-one mapping from the total state to the
device's output.

\hypertarget{the-hidden-sector}{%
\subsubsection{2.2 The Hidden Sector}\label{the-hidden-sector}}

Let the full state space be partitioned into degrees of freedom
accessible to observers (the visible sector) and degrees of freedom that
are not (the hidden sector, denoted \(\Phi\)). The hidden sector
consists of trans-horizon modes beyond the cosmological horizon,
sub-Planckian degrees of freedom below the observer's resolution limit,
and black hole interiors. The partition is defined entirely by classical
general relativity. No quantum concept enters the definition of what is
hidden from the observer.

\hypertarget{two-projections-of-the-same-thing}{%
\subsubsection{2.3 Two Projections of the Same
Thing}\label{two-projections-of-the-same-thing}}

\textbf{Projection 1: The Fluctuation Power Spectrum (QM).} QFT's
operational access to the vacuum is through the fluctuation power
spectrum. Because zero-point energies \(\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega\) are
positive-definite, the sum grows linearly:
\[V \propto \sum_{i=1}^{N} \langle \hat{\phi}_i^2 \rangle \propto N\]

\textbf{Projection 2: Mean-Field Pressure (Gravity).} The Einstein field
equations couple spacetime curvature to the macroscopic expectation
value of the stress-energy tensor. The gravitational projection couples
to the \emph{net signed mean} of the hidden-sector distribution:
\[M = \langle T_{00} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i \, |E_i|\] Assuming
the hidden sector lacks an unbroken global symmetry, the central limit
theorem dictates that the macroscopic residual of \(N\)
quasi-independent contributions scales as \(M \sim \sqrt{N}\).

\textbf{Observational Incompleteness Theorem.} Let the universe be
partitioned into visible and hidden sectors, and let the observer's
projection from the full state to the visible sector be many-to-one. No

with joint accuracy exceeding Wolpert's bounds {[}1{]}.

\subsubsection{3.1 Extracting the Hidden-Sector
Dimensionality}\label{extracting-the-hidden-sector-dimensionality}}

The Observational Incompleteness Theorem reframes the cosmological
constant discrepancy as a direct physical measurement. The variance-type
scaling grows directly with the number of modes (\(V \propto N\)) while
the macroscopic mean scales as the square root (\(M \sim \sqrt{N}\)).
Their ratio: \[\frac{V}{M} \sim \frac{N}{\sqrt{N}} = \sqrt{N}\] Setting
this equal to the observed discrepancy:
\[\sqrt{N} \sim 10^{122} \implies N \sim 10^{244}\] The
10\textsuperscript{122} ratio is the quantitative signature of
observational incompleteness --- the universe telling embedded observers
the dimensionality of the sector they cannot access.

\hypertarget{classical-premises-and-marginal-dynamics}{%
\subsection{4. CLASSICAL PREMISES AND MARGINAL
DYNAMICS}\label{classical-premises-and-marginal-dynamics}}

The Observational Incompleteness Theorem establishes that embedded
observers face irreducible epistemic constraints when probing the hidden
sector. The remainder of this paper pursues a considerably stronger
claim: that quantum mechanics itself is a necessary consequence of these
constraints. This is a significant escalation in ambition --- from
reinterpreting a known discrepancy to deriving an entire physical
framework --- and the reader is entitled to skepticism. The argument's
credibility therefore rests entirely on the transparency of its premises
and the rigor of each mathematical step. Importantly, the two central
results are logically independent: the Observational Incompleteness
Theorem stands or falls on its own merits regardless of whether the
Trace-Out Theorem is accepted, and vice versa. The derivation proceeds
from three classical premises through a chain of established
mathematical results, assuming no quantum postulate at any stage.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Premise 1: Classical Statistical Dynamics.} The total universe
  is a classical statistical system evolving deterministically via the
  Liouville equation: \[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \{H, \rho\}\]
\item
  \textbf{Premise 2: Classical General Relativity as Causal Structure.}
  Einstein's field equations determine the causal structure of
  spacetime, creating the absolute information barriers that define the
  hidden sector.
\item
  \textbf{Premise 3: Classical Probability Theory.} All statistical
  inference follows from Kolmogorov's axioms. Observational predictions
  are classical expectation values.
\end{itemize}

The observer's operational description of the visible sector is
therefore a \textbf{marginal stochastic matrix}:
\[T_{ij}(t, t_0) = \int d\gamma_h \; P(\gamma_h \mid v_i, t_0) \; \mathbb{1}\!\left[\Phi_t(v_i, \gamma_h) \in v_j\right]\]
The central question: can \(T\) be factored as a strictly divisible
Markov process, or does marginalization over the hidden sector break
divisibility?

\hypertarget{the-necessity-of-correlations}{%
\subsection{5. THE NECESSITY OF
CORRELATIONS}\label{the-necessity-of-correlations}}

If the visible and hidden sectors are statistically correlated,
divisibility generically breaks. 1. \textbf{Shared Causal History:}
Prior to cosmological horizon formation, the degrees of freedom now
separated were in direct causal contact, ensuring
\(\rho(\gamma_v, \gamma_h) \neq \rho_{\text{vis}}(\gamma_v)\,\rho_{\text{hid}}(\gamma_h)\).
2. \textbf{Conservation Laws:} Noether's theorem guarantees conserved
charges (\(E_{\text{total}} = E_v + E_h = \text{const}\)) that rigidly
couple the visible and hidden sectors. This correlation is enforced by
the symmetry structure of the Hamiltonian itself.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{generic-indivisibility}{%
\subsection{6. GENERIC INDIVISIBILITY}\label{generic-indivisibility}}

The marginal stochastic dynamics is generically non-divisible due to
topological and algebraic necessity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Failure of Lumpability:} Kemeny and Snell (1960) established
  that coarse-graining retains the Markov property only under strong
  lumpability conditions. Gurvits and Ledoux (2005) proved these
  conditions are nowhere dense. The conservation-law correlations
  violate lumpability, meaning the marginal dynamics is generically
  non-Markovian.
\item
  \textbf{Geometry of Non-Embeddability:} Casanellas et al.~(2023)
  proved that embeddable stochastic matrices form a proper
  semi-algebraic subset of strictly lower dimension for \(n \geq 3\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{the-trace-out-theorem}{%
\subsection{7. THE TRACE-OUT THEOREM}\label{the-trace-out-theorem}}

The qualitative transversality arguments of Section 6 must be elevated
to a rigorous statistical proof to formalize the generalized mechanism.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The Trace-Out Theorem.} Let the universe be a classical
statistical system governed by deterministic Liouville dynamics. Let
classical general relativity partition the system into visible and
hidden sectors, with \(N \sim 10^{244}\) inaccessible degrees of
freedom. Shared causal history and exact conservation laws enforce
non-factorizable joint probability distributions. By the Random Matrix
derivation of the Mori-Zwanzig covariance, the marginal stochastic
dynamics on the visible sector is generically indivisible with
probability 1.

By Barandes' stochastic-quantum correspondence and the continuous
complex-phase mapping, this indivisible classical process is exactly
equivalent to unitary quantum mechanics. Therefore, the quantum
formalism is not a fundamental dynamical law, but the mandatory
mathematical data-compression algorithm for any embedded observer forced
to marginalize deterministic classical mechanics over a correlated
hidden sector.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{proof-of-statistical-non-degeneracy-via-random-matrix-theory}{%
\subsubsection{7.1 Proof of Statistical Non-Degeneracy via Random Matrix
Theory}\label{proof-of-statistical-non-degeneracy-via-random-matrix-theory}}

To prove that the marginalization map
\(\mathcal{M}: (H, \rho_0, t) \to T(t)\) is non-degenerate and fills the
stochastic simplex, we model the hidden Liouvillian
\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{hid}}\) as a large matrix drawn from the Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE).

The choice of GOE requires physical justification. The hidden sector,
comprising \textasciitilde10\textsuperscript{244} trans-horizon,
sub-Planckian, and interior degrees of freedom, is a high-dimensional
system whose detailed Hamiltonian is unknown to any embedded observer.
In such regimes, the eigenvalue statistics of large, complex
Hamiltonians are universally described by random matrix theory --- a
result established empirically in nuclear physics (Wigner, Dyson) and
proven rigorously for broad classes of Hamiltonians with sufficient
complexity (Erdős--Yau universality). The GOE is the appropriate
ensemble because the underlying classical Liouville dynamics is
time-reversal symmetric and the matrix elements are real. Crucially, the
key result --- full-rank covariance of the marginal transition elements
--- is a consequence of the high dimensionality and generic coupling,
not of the specific Gaussian distribution of matrix entries. Any
ensemble with \(N \gg n\) independent parameters and no fine-tuned
symmetries that would zero out off-diagonal blocks would yield the same
conclusion. The GOE is therefore best understood not as a specific
physical hypothesis but as the maximally agnostic statistical model
consistent with the known constraints.

We define the total Liouvillian as
\(\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_0 + \delta \mathcal{L}_h\), where
\(\delta \mathcal{L}_h\) is a random fluctuation in the hidden sector.
Applying the Dyson series expansion to the Mori-Zwanzig projected
propagator, the first-order variation of the transition matrix is:
\[\delta T_{ij}(t) = \int_0^t d\tau \, \langle j | P e^{\mathcal{L}_0(t-\tau)} \delta \mathcal{L}_h e^{\mathcal{L}_0\tau} P | i \rangle\]

Because the baseline propagator \(e^{\mathcal{L}_0\tau}\) does not
factorize due to shared conservation laws, the initial state is already
correlated with the bath. The resulting covariance matrix of the
transition elements scales as:
\[C_{(ij)(kl)} = \langle \delta T_{ij} \delta T_{kl} \rangle \propto \text{Tr}(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}^\dagger \text{Cov}(\delta \mathcal{L}_h) \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}})\]

In the GOE limit where \(N \sim 10^{244} \gg n\), the vast number of
independent parameters in \(\mathcal{L}_h\) ensures that the Jacobian of
\(\mathcal{M}\) possesses full row rank. Consequently, the covariance
matrix \(C\) is strictly positive-definite. The induced measure \(P(T)\)
has full-dimensional volume support across the stochastic simplex
\(\mathcal{S}_n\). Because embeddable Markov matrices \(\mathcal{E}_n\)
occupy a zero-volume lower-dimensional submanifold, integrating this
measure over \(\mathcal{E}_n\) yields exactly zero. Marginalization over
the classical hidden sector is strictly indivisible with probability 1.

\hypertarget{barandes-stochastic-quantum-correspondence}{%
\subsubsection{7.2 Barandes' Stochastic-Quantum
Correspondence}\label{barandes-stochastic-quantum-correspondence}}

Barandes (2025) established a bijective correspondence: any indivisible
stochastic process on \(n\) configurations is exactly equivalent to a
unitary quantum system on a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), where
transition probabilities are recovered via the Born rule
\(T_{ij}(t) = |U_{ij}(t)|^2\).

\hypertarget{the-continuous-limit-emergence-of-the-schruxf6dinger-equation}{%
\subsubsection{7.3 The Continuous Limit: Emergence of the Schrödinger
Equation}\label{the-continuous-limit-emergence-of-the-schruxf6dinger-equation}}

Extending this to continuous variables, the exact classical evolution of
the visible particle is described by the non-Markovian generalized
Langevin equation:
\[m\ddot{q} + \nabla V(q) + \int_0^t K(t-\tau) \dot{q}(\tau) d\tau = F_{\text{fluct}}(t)\]

Because the horizon constraints ensure the hidden sector is finite, the
memory kernel \(K(t-\tau)\) retains a non-zero correlation time
\(\tau_E\). The dynamics are strictly indivisible. To translate this
into Barandes' unitary correspondence, we introduce the complex field
\(\psi(q,t) = \sqrt{P(q,t)} e^{iS(q,t)/\hbar}\).

A purely real probability density \(P(q,t)\) cannot encode the memory
integral because classical probability currents are strictly Markovian.
To preserve the history of the non-Markovian memory kernel \(K(t-\tau)\)
within a time-local differential framework, we must introduce a
conjugate field. This step --- identifying the need for a phase degree
of freedom as a consequence of non-Markovianity rather than postulating
it --- is the key novel element of this derivation. The complex phase
gradient \(\nabla S\) acts as the mandatory mathematical storage buffer
for the integrated historical momentum:
\[\nabla S(q,t) = m\dot{q} + \int_0^t K(t-\tau) \dot{q}(\tau) d\tau\]

The remaining steps follow from standard hydrodynamic reformulations of
wave mechanics, first introduced by Madelung (1927) and later developed
by Bohm (1952), but are here read in reverse --- from classical
non-Markovian dynamics \emph{toward} the quantum formalism, rather than
decomposing an assumed Schrödinger equation.

By substituting this generalized momentum into the classical
Fokker-Planck framework, the time-evolution of the probability density
necessitates a modified continuity equation:
\[\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( P \frac{\nabla S}{m} \right) = 0\]

Simultaneously, energy conservation enforced by the hidden sector bath
requires the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation to absorb the
fluctuation-dissipation variance as an internal pressure term. This is a
standard result in stochastic thermodynamics: a bath-coupled particle
acquires an osmotic velocity proportional to \(\nabla \ln P\). This
structural variance manifests exactly as the Bohmian quantum potential,
\(Q = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla^2 \sqrt{P}}{\sqrt{P}}\), where
\(\hbar\) emerges not as a fundamental constant, but as the scale factor
quantifying the characteristic action of the hidden sector's relaxation.

Packaging \(P(q,t)\) and \(S(q,t)\) into a single analytical complex
field \(\psi(q,t) = \sqrt{P(q,t)} e^{iS(q,t)/\hbar}\), the coupled
nonlinear hydrodynamic equations linearize into the continuous
Schrödinger equation:
\[i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(q) \right] \psi\]
The Schrödinger equation is therefore strictly derived as the unique,
time-local partial differential equation capable of generating the
indivisible marginal transition probabilities of a history-dependent
classical system.

\textbf{The Wallstrom objection.} Wallstrom (1994) {[}21{]} demonstrated
that the Madelung hydrodynamic equations are not equivalent to the
Schrödinger equation unless an additional quantization condition
\(\oint \nabla S \cdot dl = 2\pi n \hbar\) is imposed on the phase
field. This is a serious objection to any purely hydrodynamic derivation
of quantum mechanics. In the present framework, however, the Wallstrom
gap is bridged by the discrete stochastic foundation established in
Sections 6--7.2. The indivisible stochastic matrices on the discrete
configuration space already carry the full quantum structure, including
the topological quantization conditions, via Barandes' correspondence.
The continuous Schrödinger equation derived here is the continuum limit
of a dynamics whose quantum character --- including single-valuedness of
the wavefunction --- was established at the discrete level before the
hydrodynamic representation was invoked. The Madelung decomposition is
used here only as a \emph{representation} of an already-quantum process,
not as its derivation.

\hypertarget{experimental-predictions}{%
\subsubsection{7.4 Experimental
Predictions}\label{experimental-predictions}}

The framework generates two falsifiable predictions that are
quantitatively anchored to the hidden-sector dimensionality
\(N \sim 10^{244}\).

\textbf{Prediction 1: Gravitational Wave Echoes.} If spacetime curvature
is a mean-field thermodynamic variable of the hidden sector, post-merger
black hole ringdown should exhibit echoes reflecting the hidden-sector's
discrete granularity. The characteristic timescale is set by the
scrambling time of the hidden sector, modeled as a maximally chaotic
(fast-scrambling) system. For a fast scrambler with entropy \(S\), the
scrambling time scales as \(t_{\text{scr}} \sim \beta \ln S\), where
\(\beta \sim r_s / c\) is the inverse Hawking temperature and \(r_s\) is
the Schwarzschild radius. Taking the hidden-sector entropy as
\(S \sim \sqrt{N} \sim 10^{122}\) (consistent with the holographic bound
on the observable universe), the echo delay is:
\[\Delta t_{\text{echo}} \sim \frac{r_s}{c} \ln(10^{122}) \sim \frac{r_s}{c} \times 281\]
For a 30 \(M_\odot\) post-merger remnant (\(r_s \approx 90\) km), this
yields \(\Delta t_{\text{echo}} \sim 8 \times 10^{-5}\) s, placing the
signal in the 10\textsuperscript{-5}--10\textsuperscript{-4} s range
accessible to current LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA post-merger analyses. The echo
amplitude is suppressed by the reflectivity of the effective
hidden-sector boundary, which this framework predicts to be nonzero but
small --- a quantitative estimate requires solving the effective
boundary conditions and is left as an open problem.

\textbf{Prediction 2: Stochastic Gravitational Noise Floor.} The
irreducible fluctuations of the hidden sector must source a stochastic
gravitational wave background. The characteristic strain amplitude can
be estimated dimensionally. The hidden sector contributes
\(N \sim 10^{244}\) modes, each with Planck-scale zero-point energy
\(E_{\text{Pl}} \sim 10^{9}\) J, but the gravitational coupling is
suppressed by the mean-field averaging over \(\sqrt{N}\) modes. The
residual energy density in gravitational fluctuations scales as:
\[\Omega_{\text{gw}} \sim \frac{\rho_{\text{QM}}}{\rho_c} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sim \frac{10^{113}}{10^{-10}} \times 10^{-122} \sim 10^{1}\]
This naive estimate is \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) in units of the critical
density, suggesting the signal is not negligible. A more careful
spectral decomposition across the MHz--GHz band --- where astrophysical
foregrounds are minimal --- is needed to determine the precise spectral
shape, and is identified as a priority for follow-up work. Detection
would require next-generation high-frequency gravitational wave
detectors currently under development.

\hypertarget{logical-independence-of-the-two-theorems}{%
\subsubsection{8.1 Logical Independence of the Two
Theorems}\label{logical-independence-of-the-two-theorems}}

The two central results of this paper are logically independent. The
Observational Incompleteness Theorem depends only on Wolpert's inference
limits, the causal structure of general relativity, and the
identification of QM and GR vacuum energy measurements as variance-type
and mean-type projections. It does not require the Trace-Out Theorem or
any claim about the emergence of quantum mechanics. Conversely, the
Trace-Out Theorem depends on classical Liouville dynamics, classical
probability theory, the existence of a correlated hidden sector, and
Barandes' stochastic-quantum correspondence --- but it does not require
the specific identification of the cosmological constant discrepancy as
a measurement of \(N\). Each result should be evaluated on its own
premises. Together, they form a mutually reinforcing picture: the
Observational Incompleteness Theorem explains \emph{why} embedded
observers face complementary descriptions, while the Trace-Out Theorem
shows \emph{what dynamical framework} those descriptions must take.

\hypertarget{independent-corroboration-and-consistency}{%
\subsubsection{8.2 Independent Corroboration and
Consistency}\label{independent-corroboration-and-consistency}}

Wetterich (2001--2025) proved that a subsystem with ``incomplete
statistics'' over a sufficiently large classical system is necessarily
described by the quantum formalism. The independent convergence of the
Barandes/indivisibility route and the Wetterich/incomplete-statistics
route significantly strengthens the case. Importantly, the derivation
avoids circularity because the system partition is defined entirely by
classical general relativity; no quantum concept enters the premises.
Furthermore, while Bell's theorem rules out local hidden-variable
theories producing \emph{divisible} stochastic dynamics, the apparent
nonlocality here is a derived property of the indivisible marginal
description.

\hypertarget{open-problems}{%

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{9. CONCLUSION}\label{conclusion}}

This paper has demonstrated that the structural incompatibility between
quantum mechanics and general relativity is not a failure of either
theory, but the inevitable mathematical consequence of embedded
observation within a classical universe. Applying Wolpert's inference
limits to the causal horizon structure of general relativity, we
established the \textbf{Observational Incompleteness Theorem}, proving
that vacuum energy measurements are divergent projections of a shared
hidden sector. The 10\textsuperscript{122} cosmological constant
discrepancy is thus reinterpreted as a direct physical measurement of
the hidden sector's dimensionality, yielding \(N \sim\)
10\textsuperscript{244} degrees of freedom.

The transition from the \textbf{Observational Incompleteness Theorem} to
the \textbf{Trace-Out Theorem} is completed through a rigorous
mathematical derivation. By modeling the hidden-sector Liouvillian as a
Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), we proved that the covariance matrix
of marginal transition elements is full-rank, establishing that the
observer's description of the visible sector is indivisible with
probability 1. We demonstrated that the history-dependent memory kernel
\(K(\tau)\), which explicitly breaks classical divisibility, is dual to
the complex phase gradient \(\nabla S\) in a unitary representation.

Hilbert space, the Born rule, and the Schrödinger equation are therefore
revealed not as fundamental laws, but as the mandatory data-compression
algorithms for any observer forced to trace out a correlated, causally
inaccessible hidden sector. Quantum mechanics is the ``epistemic
shadow'' cast by classical mechanics when viewed from behind a
relativistic horizon. Ultimately, the universe is a deterministic system
that appears quantum precisely because we are part of the system we
attempt to measure.
