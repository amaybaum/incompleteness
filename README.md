## Overview

This repository contains a technical paper arguing that the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity is not a deficiency to be repaired, but a structural consequence of embedded observation.

The core claim: any observer that is part of the universe it measures must access reality through projections that discard causally inaccessible degrees of freedom. The quantum-mechanical and gravitational descriptions of vacuum energy correspond to variance and mean projections of a shared hidden sector, and Wolpert's mutual inference impossibility prohibits their simultaneous determination. The 10¹²² cosmological constant discrepancy is not an error — it is a measurement.

### Paper

**"The Incompleteness of Observation: Why Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity Cannot Be Unified From Within"**

The full technical paper. Introduces the Observational Incompleteness Principle via Wolpert's inference impossibility framework, derives quantum mechanics from embedded observation through the Nakajima–Zwanzig trace-out formalism and Barandes' stochastic-quantum correspondence, and extracts N ~ 10²⁴⁴ hidden-sector degrees of freedom from the cosmological constant ratio. Includes falsifiable predictions, implications for foundational paradoxes, and a detailed discussion of objections.

## Key Results

1. **Observational Incompleteness Principle.** The quantum and gravitational descriptions of vacuum energy are complementary projections of a hidden sector. No single embedded inference device can simultaneously determine both the variance-type and mean-type targets with joint accuracy exceeding Wolpert's bounds.

2. **Quantum mechanics from embeddedness.** Tracing out the trans-horizon hidden sector via the Nakajima–Zwanzig formalism yields CP-indivisible stochastic dynamics, which are mathematically equivalent to quantum mechanics by Barandes' stochastic-quantum correspondence (2023, 2025).

3. **10¹²² as measurement.** Interpreting the cosmological constant ratio as a variance-to-mean ratio yields N ~ 10²⁴⁴ hidden-sector degrees of freedom — equal to S_dS², the square of the de Sitter horizon entropy.

4. **Falsifiable predictions.** A 54 ms gravitational wave echo for a 30 M☉ black hole, and a stochastic gravitational noise floor with an inverse-frequency-squared spectrum in the MHz–GHz band.

5. **Foundational implications.** Bell's theorem addressed via dynamical indivisibility rather than nonlocality or superdeterminism; Wigner's Friend paradox natively resolved; Everettian measure problem dissolved; AdS/CFT success explained as a consequence of non-embedded (boundary) observation.
