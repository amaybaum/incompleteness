## Overview

This repository contains a main technical paper and a companion explainer arguing that the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity is not a deficiency to be repaired, but a structural consequence of embedded observation.

The core claim: any observer that is part of the universe it measures must access reality through projections that discard causally inaccessible degrees of freedom. The quantum-mechanical and gravitational descriptions of vacuum energy correspond to variance and mean estimations of a hidden sector, and Wolpert's mutual inference impossibility prohibits their simultaneous determination. The 10¹²⁰ cosmological constant discrepancy is not an error — it is a measurement.

### Main Paper

**"The Incompleteness of Observation: Why Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity Cannot Be Unified From Within"**

The full technical paper. Introduces the Complementarity Theorem via Wolpert's inference impossibility framework and extracts N ~ 10²⁴⁰ hidden-sector degrees of freedom from the cosmological constant ratio. Includes formal proofs, experimental predictions, and a detailed discussion of objections.

### Companion Explainer

**"The Incompleteness of Observation: Why the Universe's Biggest Contradiction Might Not Be a Mistake"**

An accessible companion written for physicists and scientifically literate readers who want the argument without the full formalism. Covers the same core ideas, derives quantum mechanics from embedded observation through the Barandes stochastic-quantum correspondence, and extends into re-interpretations of quantum phenomena, gravity, dark matter, dark energy, String Theory, and the logical parallels to Gödel and Turing.

## Key Results

1. **Complementarity Theorem.** The quantum and gravitational descriptions of vacuum energy are complementary projections of a hidden sector. Wolpert's bound gives ε_fluc · ε_mech ≤ 1/4 — perfect knowledge of one forces the other to chance.

2. **Quantum mechanics from embeddedness.** Tracing out a temporally correlated hidden sector generically produces indivisible stochastic processes, which are mathematically equivalent to quantum mechanics (Barandes 2023).

3. **10¹²⁰ as measurement.** Interpreting the cosmological constant ratio as a variance-to-mean ratio yields N ~ 10²⁴⁰ hidden-sector degrees of freedom — equal to S_dS², the square of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the cosmological horizon.
