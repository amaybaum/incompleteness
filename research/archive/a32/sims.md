In all three cases:
- `controls.py check E` prints `controls: check OK`;
- `tools/v3_verifier.py --verify-round Q` prints `VERDICT  HOLDS`;
- `--receipts Q` prints `RECEIPTS  7 receipt(s), all hold`;
- `tools/legacy_records_check.py Q` prints `LEGACY  303 record(s) in 75 closed namespace(s), all intact`.

The paths changed from `D` to `E` number eight on the two decided rows and six on `A32-UNDECIDED`,
where the guard and `ROADMAP.md` are untouched. Each run matches the frozen set.
